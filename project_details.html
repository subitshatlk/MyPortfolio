                <h2>Training a Continuous Bag of Words (CBoW) Model</h2>
                <p>This project focuses on training a Continuous Bag of Words (CBoW) model to generate word embeddings, following the method introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013).</p>
                <p>The implementation involved defining a vocabulary, tokenizing the text, and converting words into one-hot encoded vectors. The model architecture includes a projection layer that maps context words into dense embeddings and a classifier layer that predicts the target word from these embeddings. Training was conducted using Cross Entropy Loss, with various learning rates tested to optimize performance. The generated embeddings were evaluated on tasks like word similarity and analogy resolution, showcasing the model's ability to capture semantic relationships.</p>

                <h2>SmartDoorLock System</h2>
                <p>The Smart Door Lock System is a two-level security solution that integrates fingerprint and facial recognition to provide secure, automated door access. Built using a Raspberry Pi, this system ensures that only authorized users can unlock the door by successfully matching both fingerprint and facial inputs. When both inputs match with a pre-registered user, the door unlocks and a green LED lights up as a visual confirmation. If either input is unauthorized, the door remains locked, and a red LED alerts to the failed authentication attempt. This system is ideal for enhancing security in homes, workplaces, bank lockers, and other sensitive areas.</p>
                <h3> Hardware Components</h3>
                <p>he system employs various hardware components including a Raspberry Pi, fingerprint scanner, Pi camera, relay module, and LEDs. For software, it utilizes Python and OpenCV for real-time face detection, leveraging the Haar classifier to detect faces. The system is designed to handle multiple cases: unauthorized fingerprints trigger an alert and keep the door locked, authorized fingerprints paired with unauthorized face recognition also result in denial of access, while only the correct combination of both inputs results in unlocking the door. This comprehensive security solution demonstrates the integration of hardware and software to provide a robust, user-friendly door locking mechanism.</p>

                <h2>Language Modeling</h2>
                <p>This project explored two key approaches to language modeling: a 4-gram model and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. The 4-gram model was constructed using relative frequency counts and Laplace smoothing to predict the likelihood of a character based on the preceding three characters. This statistical approach provided a foundational method for sequence prediction, focusing on immediate context and avoiding zero probabilities for unseen n-grams. However, its simplicity limited its ability to capture longer-term dependencies in text.</p>
                <p>To address these limitations, the project implemented an LSTM network. This recurrent neural network processed input sequences into character embeddings to predict the next character in a sequence, allowing it to capture more nuanced patterns and dependencies in the data. Configured with a character embedding dimension of 50 and an LSTM hidden dimension of 200, the model was trained over multiple epochs with various learning rates. The LSTM model outperformed the n-gram model in terms of perplexity, indicating a better ability to predict complex sequences. Despite the increased computational complexity, the LSTM's superior performance demonstrated the effectiveness of neural network-based models in understanding and predicting language patterns.</p>
